It looks like your project involves classification metrics and a decision tree model. Based on that, here's a possible description for your GitHub project:

---

### **Breast Cancer Prediction Using Decision Trees**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict breast cancer using classification techniques. A **decision tree classifier** is implemented to analyze the dataset and make predictions, while various classification metrics are used to evaluate model performance.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Dataset:** Contains breast cancer-related data with features like tumor size, texture, and other characteristics.
- **Machine Learning Model:** A **Decision Tree Classifier** is applied to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** 
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**

The project aims to assist in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer by providing accurate and interpretable predictions using decision tree algorithms.

This is a general template, but if there are other aspects of the project you'd like to highlight (such as data preprocessing, visualization, etc.), feel free to let me know! I can adjust the description accordingly.
